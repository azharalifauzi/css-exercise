# css-exercise
This is my exercise to build a beautiful page using SASS, include Flexbox and CSS Grid Technique. Implemented Block Element Modifier (BEM) Metodhology, the page fully responsive too, and has really nice SASS architecture.

For non developer you can open this file with download the folder with the .zip format and extract it. Afterwards you just need to open index.html in your browser :)

However I'm not host this code on the Internet, so if you want see how the website looks like, you need to open it manually on localhost using live-sever or just open the index.html.
